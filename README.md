# Critic Markup Extension #

*Version 1.0 15 Apr 2013*

This is extension for using [Critic Markup](http://criticmarkup.com) syntax in multimarkdown documents.

## Usage ##

If you edit someone's documents, use one of four critical marks:

- **addition**
- **deletion**
- **text substitution**
- **highlight part of the text for comment**

Each selected mark may be accepted or rejected using System Services. If you don't have them in your OS download [Critical Markup Toolbox](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit/archive/master.zip)
and put available Services inside your `~/Library/Services` directory.

Services run by "ACM" and "RCM" buttons seems to be laggy and not always gives desired output. For unknown reason (at least 
on my machine) it's better to run them from right-click menu.

## To-Do ##

- [ ] Rewrite System Services for accepting and rejecting critic marks
- [ ] Add actions for accepting/rejecting marks in whole document at once
- [X] Actions should not appear in Firefox,Opera and Chrome
- [ ] Except in textarea inside those browsers
-
